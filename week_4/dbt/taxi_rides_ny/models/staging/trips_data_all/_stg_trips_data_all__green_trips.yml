      Trips made by green taxis, also known as boro taxis and street-hail liveries.
      Green taxis may respond to street hails, but only in the areas indicated in green on
      the map (i.e. above W 100 St/E 96th St in Manhattan and in the boroughs).
      The records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by
      technology service providers.
